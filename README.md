# [Metric-Imperial Converter](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/quality-assurance/quality-assurance-projects/metric-imperial-converter)

1.  I can provide my own project, not the example URL.
2.  I can GET /api/convert with a single parameter containing an accepted number and unit and have it converted. (Hint: Split the input by looking for the index of the first character which will mark the start of the unit)
3.  I can convert `'gal'` to `'L'` and vice versa. (1 gal to 3.78541 L)
4.  I can convert `'lbs'` to `'kg'` and vice versa. (1 lbs to 0.453592 kg)
5.  I can convert `'mi'` to `'km'` and vice versa. (1 mi to 1.60934 km)
6.  All incoming units should be accepted in both upper and lower case, but should be returned in both the `initUnit` and `returnUnit` in lower case, except for liter, which should be represented as an uppercase `'L'`.
7.  If my unit of measurement is invalid, returned will be `'invalid unit'`.
8.  If my number is invalid, returned will be `'invalid number'`.
9.  If both the unit and number are invalid, returned will be `'invalid number and unit'`.
10.  I can use fractions, decimals or both in my parameter(ie. 5, 1/2, 2.5/6), but if nothing is provided it will default to 1.
11.  My return will consist of the `initNum`, `initUnit`, `returnNum`, `returnUnit`, and `string` spelling out units in the format `'{initNum} {initial_Units} converts to {returnNum} {return_Units}'` with the result rounded to 5 decimals.
12.  All 16 unit tests are complete and passing.
13.  All 5 functional tests are complete and passing.
